The theme of master’s thesis is related to digital filtering and usage of PID algorithm for automatic control system development. Three digital filters were reviewed – moving average filter, median filter and Kalman filter. The algorithm of one-dimensional Kalman filter was derived from multi-dimensional algorithm (the description of multi-dimensional algorithm could be found in scientific papers). The performance of digital filters was tested and analysis of the results was done. The PID algorithm and possible ways of its improvement were described. The amplitude-frequency transfer functions of analog filters were derived.
The result of the thesis is automatic temperature control cooling system, based on PI algorithm, which is used to control fan module by calculating the PWM duty cycle for each channel. Device has an intuitive user interface (LCD display and buttons) to configure cooling system for a specific task. The final version of device is based on ATmega328P microcontroller, the code was written in C language.
Several hypotheses were formulated and checked. The results of hypotheses could be used in different projects.
